 1\ Migration guide for version 2.0
 	1.1\From Gisgraphy 1.0 and Gisgraphy 2.0 :
 		Drop database, and recreate all tables with the provided scripts in ths sql directory
        Unfortunatly there is too much changes (improvements) and it is necessary to re-run an import.
        if you want to keep the usage statistique, backup the statsusage table.
        if you want to keep users, backup the user_role, role, and app_user tables.
