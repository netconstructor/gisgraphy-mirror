<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
Hi all, my name is David Masclet, i am developer and i really like GIS and all the stuff around it.
<br/><br/>
I have started gisgraphy on november 2007, the initial goal of the project was to offer a free, opensource and esay way to use Geonames data.
<br/><br/>Gisgraphy needs you, please give us some
<a href="http://www.gisgraphy.com/feedback/">
</a>
, on the services, things you've appreciate, functionnalites you wish to have on the next release, problems you've got, bugs you 've found, ... 
Step by step, i have build the framework, first an importer with an IHM, then a geolocalisation and a fulltext webservice, a back officewith statistics, ...
<br/><br/>
Then i thought that an opensource geocoder can be useful, so i extends the framework with an importer for Openstreetmap and develop a webservice too.
<br/><br/>
My goal was to :
<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li> provide and support a lot of languages (XML, json, PHP, ruby, python, Atom, RSS / GeoRSS , more to come)</li>
    <li> A high quality software with High test coverage</li>
    <li> Easy to install, (a minimum to configure to configure)</li>
    <li> fully internationalize, with a lot of language supported</li>
    <li> provide an Opensearch module</li> 
</ul>
<br/><br/>
I hope it is the case. I am currently the only developer.
<br/>
I also have a <a href="http://www.gisgraphy.com">blog</a> (in french) where i put some tips and tutorials.
