A project called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/osm2gisgraphycsv/">osm2gisgraphycsv</a> has been created by willy tiengo and aguiar marcio to convert the Openstreetmap data from the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">openstreetmap site</a>openstreetmap site to the Gisgraphy CSV format.<br/><br/>
This programm is not used by Gisgraphy to compute the files in the <a href="http://download.gisgraphy.com">download server</a> but is an external tool.
