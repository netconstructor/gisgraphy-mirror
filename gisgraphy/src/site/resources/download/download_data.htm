<br/>
If you are interesting in downloading data you can go to :
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://download.gisgraphy.com/">Gisgraphy download server</a> if you need street data</li>
<li>The <a href="http://download.geonames.org/">Geonames download server</a> if you need to download place</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>BUT YOU DON'T need to download data by yourself, The gisgraphy importer will download it for you. you only need to download it if you are interested to use the data in an other way that Gisgraphy</b> 
<br/><br/>

A project called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/osm2gisgraphycsv/">osm2gisgraphycsv</a> has been created by willy tiengo and aguiar marcio to 
convert the Openstreetmap data from the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">openstreetmap site</a>openstreetmap site to the Gisgraphy CSV format.
<br/><br/>It gives the ability to add some files to the import. This programm is not used by Gisgraphy to compute the files in the
 <a href="http://download.gisgraphy.com">download server</a> but is an external tool. It is not develop by me, and no support will be given.

If you are interested in <a href="/download/index.htm">downloading Gisgraphy</a> you must go to that page.
