    <tr><td valign="top" style="border:0px;"><img src="/images/apostrophe_start.gif"/></td><td style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;border:0px;">I needed a reverse geocoder as a standalone solution, because I want to reverse geocode a huge volume of coordinates, as a one-time task.
I still don\'t know for sure if Gisgraphy is the thing that will do, but so far I can say I\'m impressed by this product (especially since it is developed by just one developer).
Anyway I will recommend Gisgraphy as an alternate geocoding engine to my colleagues who might also need it.</td><td valign="bottom"  style="border:0px;"><img src="/images/apostrophe_end.gif" /></td></tr>
