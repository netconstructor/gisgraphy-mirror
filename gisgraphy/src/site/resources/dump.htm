<h1>Dump</h1>
Because importing data takes a long time (more than 40 hours to import all features for all countries), i can provide a tgz file (1GO) that contains a SolR data dir and a PostgreSQL dump that corresponds to an import of all features for all countries).
<br/> I can give you a HTTP or FTP link.
