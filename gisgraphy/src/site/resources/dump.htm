<h1>Dump</h1>
Because importing data takes a long time (more than 40 hours to import all features for all countries), i provide some SQL and solR dump. They were only available by mail but i got a lot of demand, so i've decided to put them on the <a href="http://download.gisgraphy.com/dump/">Gisgraphy download server</a>. Due to Gisgraphy success, I must limit the bandwith and simultaneous download because the machine host the download server, forum, services, and the Gisgraphy sites. I try to keep a good SLA, but it cost me money and i don't plan to buy new machine. Thanks for your comprehension
